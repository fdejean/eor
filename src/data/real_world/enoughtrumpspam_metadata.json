    "text": "For r/EnoughTrumpSpam, the 2016 election was a descent from confident mockery to sheer disbelief. Early data from July shows users dismissing Trump as a 'snake oil salesman,' but the mood shifted drastically in September as polls tightened, triggering a community 'meltdown' referenced in the data. The massive engagement spike in November captures the raw shock of Election Night, transforming the subreddit from a satire hub into a digital support group for a stunned demographic.",
