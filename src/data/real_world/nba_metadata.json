Community engagement didn't just peak during the historic Game 7s of the 2016 Finals; it surged during the deep summer months of July, fueled by the suspense of free agency sagas involving stars like LeBron James and LaMarcus Aldridge. The trend is clear: the NBA has evolved into a year-round soap opera where roster moves and MVP debates generate as much intensity as the games themselves.",
